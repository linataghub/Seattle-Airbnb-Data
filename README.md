## Project Overview
In less than 10 years, Airbnb has completed disrupted the hospitality market with about 150 million users on its platform and 40% revenue growth in 2018. Their business model has become more and more attractive for homeowners who are looking for regular additional income by renting out their place to local visitors.

## Problem Statement
In this project, we will dive into the Seattle Airbnb Open Data set available on Kaggle platform to analyse the hosting market in 2016 and provide some insights for homeowners looking to set up their business plan.

We will mainly focus on three aspects:
- What are the key factors that would impact a host pricing strategy?
- What are the market trends in term of booking and listing vacancy?
- What are the key features that influence customer review?

We will try to answer those questions through various descriptive or inferential statistics and visualizations that can be easily communicated to potential business partners.

## The Data Set
The data set contains existing listing and pricing schedule information for 3818 properties in Seattle recorded on 04 January 2016.

The data is divided in two files:
- calendar.csv - Price and availability of the listing properties as of 04 January 2016.
- listings.csv - Full descriptions of the listing properties and average review score

## Methodology
The project follows the CRISP-DM Process which breaks the data mining process into six major phases:
- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Modeling
- Evaluation
- Deployment
